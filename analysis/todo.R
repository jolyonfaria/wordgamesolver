# TODO and ideas list

# 1. Add tests for 1x1 and 2 x 2 matrices
# 2. Add method using graph theory show that this gets very slow with high dimensions (compare speed with this method)
# 3. Make function to run benchmark
# 4. Fix 2-mers
# 5. Rewrite functions (after tests written)
# 6. Revise the function documentation
# 7. Make 2 separate functions for loading known words, and adding new known words
# 8. Use packrat
# 9. Test get_path
# 10. Complete failing tests for find_possible_words
# 11. Make report for benchmark which can be rendered in github
# 12. Make shiny app
# 13. Add link to benchmark in README
# 14. Benchmark time is for creating matrix and solving it, and not just solving it. Needs fixing.
