# wordsearchgame
Tools to provide hints for a word search game.

## Word list

This package requires a word list. The word list must be added to the directory `inst/extdata` and comprise 2 columns: word and word frequency. I recommed the file `count_1w.txt` from this [resource](https://norvig.com/ngrams/).

1. Open RStudio
